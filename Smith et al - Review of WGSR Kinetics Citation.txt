Smith, Byron & Muruganandam, L. & Murthy, Loganathan & Shantha, Shekhar. (2010). A Review of the Water Gas Shift Reaction Kinetics. International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering - INT J CHEM REACT ENG. 8. 10.2202/1542-6580.2238. The world's progression towards the Hydrogen economy is facilitating the production of hydrogen from various resources. In the carbon based hydrogen production, Water gas shift reaction is the intermediate step used for hydrogen enrichment and CO reduction in the synthesis gas. This paper makes a critical review of the developments in the modeling approaches of the reaction for use in designing and simulating the water gas shift reactor. Considering the fact that the rate of the reaction is dependent on various parameters including the composition of the catalyst, the active surface and structure of the catalyst, the size of the catalyst, age of the catalyst, its operating temperature and pressure and the composition of the gases, it is difficult to narrow down the expression for the shift reaction. With different authors conducting experiments still to validate the kinetic expressions for the shift reaction, continuous research on different composition and new catalysts are also reported periodically. Moreover the commercial catalyst manufacturers seldom provide information on the catalyst. This makes the task of designers difficult to model the shift reaction. This review provides a consolidated listing of the various important kinetic expressions published for both the high temperature and the low temperature water gas shift reaction along with the details of the catalysts and the operating conditions at which they have been validated.
